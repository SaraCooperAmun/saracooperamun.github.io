### Overview
During my **final-year undergraduate Erasmus+ research project** at **Mondragon University (2017–2018)**, I had my first hands-on experience with robotics.  

The project focused on developing **rehabilitation and cognitive games for older adults** using **SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper robot**, aimed at supporting cognitive exercises and engagement in elderly users with mild cognitive impairments.

This project was formative in motivating my career in **social and assistive robotics**, particularly in healthcare applications.

### My Contribution
I was responsible for:

- **Software development for Pepper** using **Python and Javascript**  
- Integrating the robot with a **MySQL database** for patient data collection and identification  
- Developing a **web interface** with Django for caregivers to track patient progress  
- Implementing **gesture recognition** with the **3D Intel Euclid Developer Kit**  
- Preparing **ethical approval documentation** for testing with elderly users  
- Conducting **initial user tests**, which showed very positive engagement

**Technical skills demonstrated:** robot programming, database integration, web development, gesture recognition, HRI design, ethical research practices.
