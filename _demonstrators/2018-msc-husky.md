### Overview
During my **MSc in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University (2018–2019)**, I participated in an interactive program with multiple **group projects**, which served as my major introduction to robotics after a background in biomedical engineering.  

One of my projects involved using **Clearpath’s Husky robot equipped with two dual UR5 grippers** to perform **simulated rescue missions**, navigating to specific areas and picking up limpets in a controlled environment.

This project was part of the **ORCA Hub initiative**, focusing on underwater robotics and collaborative autonomy.

### My Contribution
I contributed to:

- **Robot navigation** using ROS-based autonomy  
- **Manipulator control** for picking and placing objects (dual grippers)  
- **Integration of navigation and manipulation** in a simulated rescue scenario  
- Collaborative work within a **group-based MSc project**, including planning, testing, and debugging  

Code for grasping is [available at Github](https://github.com/SaraCooperAmun/Dual_Husky_Grasping).
