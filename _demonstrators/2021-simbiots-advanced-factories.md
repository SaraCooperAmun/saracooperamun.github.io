### Overview
Official **project demonstrator** of the **SIMBIOTS project**, showcased at **Advanced Factories 2021** in Barcelona.

**SIMBIOTS** (funded by **RIS3CAT**) focuses on introducing **collaborative robotics in Industry 4.0**, enabling robots from different partner organisations to safely operate alongside human workers without physical barriers. The project targets improved **worker ergonomics**, **safety**, and **productivity** in industrial environments.

Within SIMBIOTS, **PAL Robotics** implemented the **TIAGo robot** to adapt collaborative robotic capabilities to real industrial processes.

### My Contribution
I contributed to the **design and development of the admittance control system** enabling safe and compliant **physical human–robot collaboration** during the demonstrator.

My work focused on:
- Implementing **admittance control strategies** to regulate robot motion in response to external forces
- Ensuring **safe, compliant interaction** between TIAGo and a human operator in a shared workspace
- Supporting real-time **human–robot cooperation** without physical barriers
- Contributing to the system integration used in the public demonstrator at Advanced Factories

### Demonstrator Description
The demonstrator presented at Advanced Factories featured a real-world **human–robot collaborative task**, including:

- **TIAGo** performing a cleaning task on an actual industrial device (car factory emblems)
- Physical collaboration with a human worker in a shared workspace
- Use of **ROS Control** combined with the developed **admittance control** to ensure compliant interaction
- Real-time adaptation of robot behavior to human motion and contact forces
