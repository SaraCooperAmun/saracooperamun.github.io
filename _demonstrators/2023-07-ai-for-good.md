### Overview
Shortly after joining **Honda Research Institute Japan**, I participated in the **AI For Good Global Summit 2023**, presenting **Haru, the tabletop social robot**.  

The event showcased **interactive social robotics applications**, and visitors could engage with Haru in several ways:

- **Expressions & Interaction:** Haru makes faces, moves its head, looks around, and produces sounds  
- **Storytelling:** Haru starts a story and the user continues it, demonstrating social and interactive engagement  
- **Photo Capture:** Haru takes photos of people and prints them out, providing a fun, interactive experience

### My Contribution
I contributed to:

- **Robot programming and behavior design** for Haru  
- Preparing and running **interactive demos** at the event booth  
- Engaging visitors and explaining **Haru’s social and assistive capabilities**  
- Highlighting the robot’s unique **expressive features** and **interactive applications**  

This demonstration was an excellent opportunity to showcase **my current research in social robotics** and engage with an international audience interested in AI and assistive technology.
