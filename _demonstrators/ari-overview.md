### Overview
During my time as **ARI Robot Technical Expert**, I supported the **product management** of ARI, a high-performance social robot designed for healthcare and assistive applications. I was also the 
technical contact of several of its healthcare projects, both national (AMIBA) and EU (SPRING, SHAPES).

This role involved coordinating between **business, marketing, managers, and the technical team** to define, maintain, and prioritize features of the robot, ensuring it met both user and project requirements.

This section showcases selected technical demonstrators I contributed to, highlighting ARI’s capabilities in healthcare and assistive scenarios.
It also reflects my participation in **events and conferences**, demonstrating ARI to prospective clients and collaborators.

### ARI WebGUI
Demonstration of the **ARI Robot WebGUI**, the web-based interface developed to remotely operate and monitor ARI.

Key features include:
- Remote **control of navigation and manipulation**
- Real-time **sensor data and robot status monitoring**
- Integration with **healthcare and assistive applications**

**My Contribution:** I contributed to the **design and integration of the WebGUI**, ensuring the interface supported safe and effective remote operation, and coordinating requirements with the product team.

### ARI at Conferences and Events
I also had the opportunity to **represent ARI at various conferences and events**, engaging with researchers, industry professionals, and potential collaborators. My responsibilities included:

- Demonstrating ARI’s capabilities in **healthcare and assistive robotics** through EU projects I
  worked on: H2020 SHAPES, H2020 SPRING. 
- Explaining **technical features and applications** to diverse audiences  
- Supporting **networking and collaboration opportunities**  

Notable events include:

#### ICSR 2022 — Florence, Italy
