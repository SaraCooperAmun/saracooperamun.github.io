I’m a robotics software and biomedical engineer passionate about improving human–robot interaction and developing user-friendly social robots, particularly for healthcare and assistive applications. I am currently a **Research Scientist at IIIA‑CSIC** ([Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Spanish National Research Council, Barcelona](https://www.iiia.csic.es/en-us/)), where I am working on building a low-cost social robot for autism therapy.  

Previously, I worked in industry and research roles focused on social robotics and human-robot interaction:  

- **Social Robotics Research Engineer, [PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com)** (July 2024 – March 2025, Barcelona, Spain): Developed social robots ARI and TIAGo, focusing on human perception, speech interaction, and healthcare projects.  
- **Human-Robot Interaction Research Scientist, [Honda Research Institute Japan](https://www.jp.honda-ri.com/)** (April 2023 – March 2024, Wako, Japan): Worked on social robotics systems such as Haru, improving robot behavior and communication, with collaborative projects in Europe and the USA.  
- **Technical Expert & Robotics Software Engineer, PAL Robotics** (January 2020 – January 2023, Barcelona, Spain): Managed social robot projects, including EU-funded initiatives (SPRING and SHAPES), while developing software for TIAGo and ARI.  
- **Robotics Intern, Middlesex University** (October 2017 – June 2018, London, UK): Developed cognitive games and data integration systems for the Pepper robot aimed at elderly users with cognitive impairments.  

I hold a **Master’s in Robotics, Autonomous and Interactive Systems** from Heriot-Watt University (2018–2019) and a **Bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering** from Mondragon Unibertsitatea (2014–2018). 

My long-term goal is to continue using co-design methods to increase social robot acceptability and facilitate their adoption in healthcare, education, and everyday life.
