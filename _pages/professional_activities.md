As robots become increasingly integrated into everyday life—as receptionists, tour guides, home assistants, or companions—they encounter the **complex realities of real-world deployment**: unpredictable environments, dynamic social contexts, and human expectations that often exceed current capabilities.

**PubRob-Fails 2025** provided a platform for researchers, designers, and practitioners to reflect critically on the technical, social, and organisational challenges of deploying robots in public and private spaces. The workshop encouraged **open discussion of both successes and failures**, including stories that rarely make it into traditional conference sessions—such as unexpected breakdowns, messy real-world data, and valuable lessons learned.

Key goals of the workshop:

- Promote a **culture of “failing forward”** in HRI research  
- Share insights from **real-world deployment experiences**  
- Foster **error acknowledgement and transparency**, turning setbacks into steppingstones for progress
