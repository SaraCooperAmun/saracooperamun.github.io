With the global population aging and the rise of patients with multiple chronic conditions, healthcare costs are increasing, making the optimization of hospital and in-home care crucial. This paper reviews the challenges faced by older adults, people with mobility constraints, hospital patients, and isolated healthcare users, and explores how socially assistive robots can support them. The focus is on PAL Robotics’ ARI, a high-performance social robot designed for multi-modal expressive gestures, gaze, and personalized behavior. ARI has potential in healthcare for providing first-care assistance and emotional support, especially to isolated users such as the elderly or patients confined due to infectious diseases like COVID-19. Its technical features and potential applications are discussed.
