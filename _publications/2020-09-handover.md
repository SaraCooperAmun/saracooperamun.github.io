Human–robot joint action is essential in applications where robots collaborate with humans on physical tasks. While robots are designed to model and predict human actions, little is known about how humans represent a robot’s actions within their own action plans. This paper presents a combined psychological and HRI user study in the context of human–robot handover tasks. Results show a positive user experience, with participants adopting gaze patterns similar to those observed in human–human handovers. EEG analysis indicates increased motor readiness during robot handovers compared to solo actions, suggesting heightened planning demands in human–robot interaction. These findings highlight the role of gaze as an effective non-verbal communication cue in HRI and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human–robot joint action.
