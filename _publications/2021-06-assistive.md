Over the coming decades, the societal goal of maximizing the number of older adults who experience positive aging trajectories has been established. To achieve this, innovative technology-based interventions tailored to older adults’ functional levels and focused on healthy lifestyles are considered essential. This work presents a cluster of digital solutions aimed at supporting and maintaining healthy, independent living for older adults who face permanent or temporary reductions in functionality and capabilities.
