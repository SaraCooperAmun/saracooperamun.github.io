With the global population aging and the number of healthcare users requiring support increasing, optimizing and supporting independent living for older adults is crucial. This paper reviews the needs and challenges of older adults who prefer to age healthily at home and explores how socially assistive robots (SAR) can help. The focus is on the social robotics application developed for the H2020 SHAPES project, using PAL Robotics’ ARI, a high-performance social robot designed for multi-modal expressive gestures, gaze, and personalized behavior. ARI is integrated with digital solutions from the SHAPES project to enhance human-robot interaction and user acceptability for independent living support. Validation will take place at Clinica Humana (Mallorca, Spain), and this paper describes the scenario, validation plan, and strategies to improve user engagement during pilot assessments.
