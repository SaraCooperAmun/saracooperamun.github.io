This paper introduces a Behaviour Tree based design of long-term social robot behaviour in the context of SHAPES project, using ROS-compatible libraries, specifically two types of behaviours: a robot idle behaviour where the human approaches and begins the interaction, and a second behaviour where the robot actively navigates and searchers for a specific user to deliver a reminder. The behaviours will be tested on-site as part of SHAPES pilots and adjusted based on feedback and needs and is focused on long-term robot acceptance.
