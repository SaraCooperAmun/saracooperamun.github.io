Life expectancy is increasing with time, and with it, more support is needed to provide care for the elderly. Social robots may in this context support therapy, monitoring, or entertainment activities. This paper describes current work on deploying our social robot ARI at an elderly day care centre, focused on promoting engagement in the routines carried out at the centre. By using a user-centred design approach, the paper presents the prototype development process of three activities and their initial validation in a 2-day pilot study. The preliminary results highlight an increasing responsive behaviour of the elderly towards the robot on day 2 compared to day 1 in one of the activities. In contrast, in a second activity, the robot was mostly ignored, suggesting that further work must be done in terms of attracting the attention of the user, and not giving for granted that the mere presence of a robot will suffice to trigger curiosity towards initiating interactions.
