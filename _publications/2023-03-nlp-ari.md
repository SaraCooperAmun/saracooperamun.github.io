We demonstrate how state-of-the-art open-source tools for automatic speech recognition (Vosk) and dialogue management (Rasa) can be integrated on a social robotic platform (PAL Robotics’ ARI) to enable rich verbal interactions. Our open-source, ROS-based pipeline follows the ROS4HRI standard, and the demonstration details the integration to allow replication on other robots. The work is presented in the context of assistive robotics and elderly care—domains with unique interaction challenges for which ARI has been designed and extensively tested in real-world settings.
