With increasing life expectancy and staff shortages, understanding the needs of older adults and exploring emerging fields such as social robotics has become urgent. This paper highlights the importance of cognitive and physical support, reducing loneliness, increasing social engagement, and alleviating caregiver burden, and discusses how socially assistive robots (SAR) can help address these needs. It also identifies key challenges in the design and deployment of SAR systems, emphasizing the importance of end-user involvement to improve acceptability and adoption. Finally, the paper describes PAL Robotics’ approaches to real-world deployment of the ARI and TIAGo social robots and presents examples of their use in addressing diverse healthcare needs.
