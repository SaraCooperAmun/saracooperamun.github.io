While social robots for children have mostly focused on traditional education such as language, science, and math, applications promoting cultural competency are rare. This paper presents a robot-mediation framework for cross-cultural communication, enabling a social robot to act as a mediator between schoolchildren from different countries. A participatory design activity by an interdisciplinary team defined the robot’s roles, design, and technical requirements, which were then used to build the prototype system. A pilot study with high school students in Japan and Australia demonstrated the system’s potential to engage children in communicating, sharing, and discussing cultural themes with their remote peers.
