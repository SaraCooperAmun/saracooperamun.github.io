This paper presents the TIAGo Head, a new tabletop social robot from PAL Robotics, focusing on its capabilities as an HRI platform. We detail the robots’ hardware, highlighting its sensors/actuators and on-board computing; and its software architecture, including social perception, expressive face, a knowledge base, and integration with large language models (LLMs) for natural conversations. We also describe a use-case in a receptionist scenario where TIAGo Head dynamically interacts with travelers by displaying news and conversing.
