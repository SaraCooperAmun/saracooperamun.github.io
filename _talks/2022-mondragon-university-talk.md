### Overview
Invited talk delivered at **Mondragon University** to students enrolled in the **MSc in Robotics and Automation**, a newly established programme at the time.

This invitation was particularly meaningful, as Mondragon University is where I completed my **BSc in Biomedical Engineering**, and it was a privilege to return and share my professional experience with the next generation of robotics engineers.

### Talk Content
The talk presented applied research and industrial work carried out at **PAL Robotics**, focusing on **mobile robot navigation** and real-world deployment.

Using **TIAGo Base** as a concrete example, I discussed:
- Core concepts in mobile robot navigation  
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** techniques  
- Live demonstrations using the **Gazebo simulator** to illustrate navigation pipelines  

The presentation then bridged simulation and theory with practice, showing how these technologies are **deployed in real factory and manufacturing environments**, such as for disinfection, shelves management
in Industry4.0 and shops, highlighting challenges such as robustness, safety, and scalability.

### Audience and Context
The audience consisted primarily of master students specialising in robotics, many of whom were engaging with mobile robotics concepts in an applied setting for the first time.

The talk aimed to provide:
- A realistic view of transitioning from academic research to industrial robotics  
- Insight into how foundational robotics algorithms are used in production systems  
- Motivation for students entering a rapidly evolving robotics field
