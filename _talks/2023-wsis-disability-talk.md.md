### Talk Contribution
In my talk, I shared my **personal and professional journey as a woman with a hearing impairment** and how this lived experience has shaped my career path in **social robotics research**.

I discussed how my strong motivation to work on **assistive and social robotics for healthcare** is, to a large extent, rooted in my experience of disability. Rather than framing disability solely as a limitation, the talk emphasised how personal challenges can become a **source of strength, resilience, and purpose**, influencing both scientific direction and societal impact.

Through this perspective, I highlighted how real-world needs and lived experience can inform the design of **inclusive, human-centred robotic systems**, particularly in healthcare contexts, and how research grounded in such experiences can lead to more meaningful and responsible technological innovation.
