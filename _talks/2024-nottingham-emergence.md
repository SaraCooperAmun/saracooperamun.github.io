### Context
**EMERGENCE** is a UK-based research and training programme centred on robotics, autonomy, and intelligent systems, with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world impact.

This invited lecture was delivered within the summer school programme and followed a similar thematic structure to my **ICSR invited workshop talk**, adapted for a training-oriented audience of:
- PhD students and early-career researchers  
- Academic researchers in robotics and AI  
- Participants interested in applied and socially relevant robotics  

There were about 20 participants in total. 
I was also one of the evaluators for the students' group projects, who were instructed to develop
a robotic application within the 5-day duration of the summer school.

- Challenges of deploying robots outside controlled laboratory settings  
- Human–robot interaction in unstructured, real-world environments  
- Evaluation methodologies for social and assistive robots  
- Lessons learned from applied research and industrial collaboration
