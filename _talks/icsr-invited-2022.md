### Context
The HEART-MET workshop was part of the **European Union Horizon 2020 METRICS project**, which aims to bridge the gap between:
- Robotics research and development  
- Real-world deployment in **complex, unstructured home environments**

My contribution was an **invited talk** within the workshop program. where I presented real-world cases of PAL Robotics in different assistive scenarios, such as supporting older adults with reminders or 
cognitive games, and the need of metrics in order to properly evaluate deployment success.

### Workshop Focus Areas
The 2022 edition addressed benchmarking and evaluation across several key capabilities for social assistive robots, including:
- Object detection  
- Person detection  
- Activity recognition  
- Gesture recognition  
- Item handover and delivery
